# Cursor Rules

A collection of `.mdc` rules for [Cursor](https://cursor.com) to that I use in my workflows.

## Structure

```
.cursor/rules/
├── convex_rules.mdc
├── decision-making.mdc
├── file-length-modularity.mdc
├── general.mdc
├── research-guidelines.mdc
└── tailwind-v4.mdc
```

## Usage

### Manual Install

Copy the `.cursor/rules/` directory into your project root. Cursor will automatically pick up rules from this location.

### Automatic

As of January 2026, the Cursor Nightly version has a "From GitHub" functionality. So you can just link it and apply them to your project that way.

Just put in this repo URL:
`https://github.com/robinebers/cursor-rules.git`

Good luck!
